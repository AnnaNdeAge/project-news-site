# News Site
A news site with a main article and a grid of article. Used both flex box and grid to layout the page. The page need to be responsive.


## The problem
I drew a sketch of the news site on paper. Decided to use flex box for the header and a grid for the main article and the grid of small articles. Would have been better with grid for the whole page layout, if I had more time I would have changed to grid of the whole page. 

If I would have more time I would have used some CSS animations.Include some links and buttons.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
