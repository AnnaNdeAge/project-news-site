# News Site
A news site with a main article and a grid of article. Used both flex box and grid to layout the page. The page need to be responsive.


## The problem
I drew a sketch of the news site on paper. Decided to use flex box for the header and a grid for the main article and the grid of small articles. Would have been better with grid for the whole page layout, if I had more time I would have changed to grid of the whole page. 

If I would have more time I would have used some CSS animations.Include some links and buttons.
